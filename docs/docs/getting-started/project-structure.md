# Project structure

Every Elmish Land application has a folder structure that looks something like this:

```
MyProject
├── global.json
├── MyProject.fsproj
├── MyProject.sln
├── elmish-land.json
└── src
    ├── Shared.fs
    └── Pages
        └── Home
            └── Page.fs
```

You'll also find common files like .gitignore.

## Project files
Here's a breakdown of what those files and folders are:

* `/global.json` - Specify which version of .NET to use.
* `/MyProject.sln` - The F# solution file for working from an IDE
* `/MyProject.fsproj` - The F# project file
* `/elmish-land.json` –  The configuration file for Elmish Land.
* `/src/Shared.fs` - Shared data between your pages. 
* `/src/Pages/` – The home for your page files, which correspond to URLs in your app.
* `/src/Layouts/` – Layouts allow you to nest pages within common UI.
